# Auto Claim Stake Bot

**Auto Claim Stake Bot** is a tool designed to help users automatically claim promotion codes specifically for the Stake platform through a Chrome extension. This bot simplifies the process, allowing users to effortlessly claim their rewards without manual intervention.

## Features

- **Chrome Extension-Based:** The bot operates through a Chrome extension that automatically captures and processes promotion codes while you navigate the Stake platform.
- **Auto Claim Functionality:** It automatically detects and claims promotion codes available on the Stake platform on behalf of the user.
- **Instant Telegram Notifications:** Once a code is successfully claimed, you will receive an instant notification on Telegram.

- **Multiple Code Categories:** Supports various types of promotion codes tailored for Stake users.

## How It Works

1. **Install the Extension**:
    - Add the Auto Claim Stake extension to your Chrome browser via the link (include the extension link here).
    - Configure your Telegram API Token to receive notifications.

2. **Automatic Code Claiming**:
    - The extension continuously monitors the Stake platform for promotional codes.
    - When a code is detected, it will be automatically claimed, and you'll receive a notification on Telegram.

3. **Telegram Notifications**:
    - The notification messages will look like this:
